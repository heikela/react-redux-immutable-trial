Naive code, svg, scaling, circles

setinteral 10
when at 6600 items, approx 3 items / sec

vnode walk without shouldComponentUpdate
clear slowdown, down to at most 3 items / sec by 2000 items

shouldComponentUpdate added for GraphContainer
much lighter workload on the javascript side
with setinterval 100, at 5000 items still staying approx true to 10 points / sec
most updates are only 3 ms, every fifth some 30. Reason unclear.

with setinterval 10, the CPU load goes close to 100%. ~50% scripting, rest rendering and painting
at 8000 items:
- quicker frames at approx 4 ms scripting, 16 rendering, 12 painting
- some slower frames at > 100 ms scripting

around 17k items, slowdown to < 20 items per sec.
seems like opening dev tools slows things down further so hard to say without
actual instrumentation.

at 46k items, updates had slowed down to 2 items per sec with devtools open, and
timeline view was becoming unresponsive
